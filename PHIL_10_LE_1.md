# PHIL 10 Lecture 1
- ## 1/8
	- ## Logic

### What is Logic?

- Logic is the science of valid arguments.
	- What kind of science is logic?
		- Physical sciences vs. abstract sciences.
			- Physical sciences study observable events and substances
				- physics, chemistry, biology, sociology...
			- Abstract sciences study patterns or structures
				- mathematics, logic, some parts of economics. . .
	- Whatâ€™s a valid argument?

#### Why is logic important?

- Logic provides foundations for:
	- Mathematics
	- Linguistics
	- Computer science
	- Artificial intelligence
	- Analytic philosophy
	- . . . and much more.

- Identifies constraints on reasoning and rationality
- Distinguishing good vs. bad arguments
- **Identifying misleading ambiguity and triviality**
- Idealized model for understanding natural language (syntax and semantics)
- Formal languages used in (e.g.) Computer Science

#### Examples

- Misleading ambiguities resolvable with logic
	- (Name) who never saw a dog and didn't smile
		- Every time she saw a dog, she smiled
		- She never saw a dog and new smiled
			- linguistic ambiguity
	- A toddler has shot a person every week in the US for two years straight
		- A different toddler in the world
		- or a single toddler
			- structural ambiguity
- Misleading triviality
	- Consider the fact that not a single gun crime has ever been committed by a law-abiding gun owner.
		- doesn't tell us anything or narrow down
		- by definition law-abiding hasn't committed a crime
		- trivially true - don't actually provide information
	- Everything in the universe is either a potato or not a potato
		- not ruling out any possibilities
		- no matter what will be true

### Course Overview


1. Logical concepts and symbolization
	- Necessity, possibility, and impossibility; consistency, necessary equivalence, and validity.
	- Translating natural language sentences to formal logic.
	- Truth-functional operators: *not, and, or, if...then, if and only if*.
2. Semantics of truth-functional logic
	- Truth tables
	- Establishing that sentences have **logical properties**.
3. Formal proofs
	- Proving that an argument is valid.  
	- Proofs of other logical properties.
